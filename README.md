# Motorsports Physics

This game encourages users to learn physics by racing on the world's most famous tracks. Each track has unique topics and sublevels. You can choose to go racing alone in a peaceful, relaxing atmosphere or race against super-fast rivals. Who knows — the chance that one day you will be racing against Max Verstappen is small, but never zero.

**Features:**

- Interactive track simulator for tuning speed, lines and transforms
- Short quizzes that turn physics concepts into racecraft decisions
- Multiple modes: solo practice, rival races, configurable difficulty

**Notes**
- The project targets .NET 8.0.
